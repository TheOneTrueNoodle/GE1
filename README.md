We are planning to create a futuristic household microwave, installed with a variety of strange holograms that can be interacted with that allow the microwave to fulfil a lot more than its normal duties. 

Our plan is to have a very simple looking microwave, with an additional set of buttons that will create a rave like holographic effect. There will be a set of 10 buttons, with each button creating a different unique effect. The buttons development will each be seperated into their own branch. The buttons planned for the final submission are as followed:

Erin Buttons:
1. 
2. 
3. 
4.
5.

Ryan Buttons:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

The microwave will be interactable in both AR and VR with two seperate builds, a vr build and an ar build.
