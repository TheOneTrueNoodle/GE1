We are planning to create a futuristic household microwave, installed with a variety of strange holograms that can be interacted with that allow the microwave to fulfil a lot more than its normal duties. 

Our plan is to have a very simple looking microwave, with an additional set of buttons that will create a rave like holographic effect. There will be a set of 10 buttons, with each button creating a different unique effect. The buttons development will each be seperated into their own branch. The buttons planned for the final submission are as followed:

Erin Buttons:
1. Creates a tentacle
2. Causes a disco inside the microwave (You are not invited and the food will have fun)
3. opens/closes the microwave door
4. Randomises hologram texture
5. Animates tentacle

Ryan Buttons:
1. Creates random food inside microwave
2. Rotates food inside microwave
3. Shoots food out the microwave (removes food)
4. Explode the food violently
5. Changes textures

The microwave will be interactable in both AR and VR with two seperate builds, a vr build and an ar build.
